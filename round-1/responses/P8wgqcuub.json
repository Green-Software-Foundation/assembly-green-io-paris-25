  "response": "Hi!\r\nSome fast notes in between talks, to answer today's questions:\r\n\r\nI believe not one person or group carries all responsibilities, it should be shared. Not assuming others will.\r\nCurrently governments can guide and put up regulations, but eventually the layers underneath need to implement\r\nWhile governments can guide the overall lines and sustainability goals. Companies/institutions decide how software is developed and run. It comes to them to implement regulations in practical ways. The persons deciding should be a collective. Get the expertise and prioritise on values.\r\nWhat are financial choices, technical limits etc. And try to align them with your/governmental sustainable priorities and values.\r\nBarriers will for sure be in waiting for others to take responsibility. Only listening to regulations but forgetting about looking at your own sustainable values for the future. Then you'll always be behind.",
