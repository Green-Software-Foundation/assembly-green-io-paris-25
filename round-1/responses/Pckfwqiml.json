When you think about the environmental impact of software, who comes to\r\nmind as responsible for it, and why did that person or group come to mind?*\r\n\r\nWhen I think about the environmental impact of software, I do not picture a\r\nsingle owner. I think of the people whose decisions shape how systems\r\nbehave once they are in production. Engineers and architects come to mind\r\nfirst because every design choice they make becomes energy somewhere in the\r\nchain. Their decisions influence CPU cycles, memory use, network traffic,\r\nand overall data movement, which eventually turn into electricity consumed.\r\nPlatform and cloud teams follow naturally, because the way they configure\r\nscaling, instance sizes, containers, limits, and runtime defaults\r\nestablishes the baseline efficiency of everything that runs on top of it.\r\nProduct owners and engineering managers also influence the outcome because\r\nthey decide which work gets prioritised and when teams are allowed to slow\r\ndown and optimise rather than rushing new features out the door. Vendors\r\nplay a role as well because their managed services and opaque systems\r\ndictate how much energy is already consumed before an organisation touches\r\nthe code. Leadership completes the picture, because the framing they give\r\nto engineering work defines whether sustainability becomes a real concern\r\nor something easily pushed aside.\r\n\r\nEven with all these groups in mind, I start from a belief that most people\r\ngenuinely want to make good choices. Teams rarely ignore sustainability out\r\nof bad intent. They are simply under pressure to ship, to hit deadlines,\r\nand to keep up with demand. In that reality responsibility becomes\r\ndistributed not because no one cares but because the work is fast moving\r\nand full of trade offs that accumulate into environmental impact whether\r\nanyone intended it or not.\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n*2. In your experience, who is currently making decisions about the\r\nenvironmental impact of software? Is it the right set of people?*\r\n\r\nIn practice most decisions that influence the environmental impact of\r\nsoftware are made indirectly. Infrastructure teams shape energy usage\r\nthrough scaling policies and provisioning choices even when sustainability\r\nis not their explicit focus. FinOps teams try to optimise cloud bills,\r\nwhich sometimes aligns with energy efficiency and sometimes does not.\r\nDevelopers influence efficiency through their design and coding choices but\r\nusually only when they have the time, and when the impact is visible enough\r\nto matter during a sprint. ESG teams track carbon footprints for reporting\r\npurposes, yet they are rarely in a position to change the underlying\r\ntechnical decisions. Vendors and cloud providers also make decisions on the\r\ncustomer’s behalf simply through the way their platforms behave.\r\n\r\nSo the decision making today is scattered. The people involved are partly\r\nthe right people but they are not aligned in a way that supports\r\nintentional action. Operational leaders often focus on staying within\r\nshrinking budgets rather than addressing systemic inefficiencies. CFO level\r\noversight tends to appear when costs explode, not as a partner in\r\nsustainable design. And because most delivery teams operate under constant\r\npressure the idea of stopping to reduce waste rarely makes it into the\r\nplanning cycle.\r\n\r\nThis is why I believe organisations need a cleanup crew, a dedicated group\r\nfocused on the areas with the highest footprint or the highest cost or the\r\ngreatest user scale or the most critical business processes. Their work\r\nwould not replace engineering teams but rather support them by identifying\r\nwhere improvements matter most. For this to work they would need explicit\r\nsupport from the board. Without that kind of sponsorship sustainability\r\nremains optional and easily overridden by short term deadlines.\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n*3. What barriers have you or your organisation encountered when trying to\r\naddress software’s environmental impact?*\r\n\r\nThe biggest barrier is a lack of visibility. Most organisations cannot see\r\nenergy consumption at the level where engineering and architectural\r\ndecisions are made. Without clear insight into watt hours per request or\r\nthe energy cost of specific code paths sustainability becomes abstract\r\nrather than actionable. A second barrier is the constant pressure to\r\ndeliver. Teams want to make improvements yet deadlines, customer\r\nexpectations, and issue backlogs push efficiency work out of view. Another\r\nbarrier is the separation between ESG reporting and engineering practice.\r\nSustainability data and software design often live in completely different\r\nparts of the organisation, which makes alignment difficult. Cloud\r\nabstraction adds another obstacle because much of the energy footprint is\r\ncontrolled by services that teams cannot see or influence directly.\r\nCultural assumptions also appear such as the belief that sustainability\r\nbelongs to someone else or that the gains are too small to matter even\r\nthough many improvements can reduce waste by orders of magnitude.\r\n\r\nThere is also a human dimension that matters a lot. People generally want\r\nto do the right thing. Engineers and managers and operational staff care\r\nabout quality and efficiency but they work inside systems full of time\r\npressure, unpredictable incidents, and competing demands. Operational\r\nleaders often focus on keeping budgets stable rather than reducing waste at\r\nthe systemic level. These constraints make it hard for teams to address\r\nenvironmental impact consistently.\r\n\r\nThis is why a cleanup crew is needed. A focused group that can identify and\r\naddress inefficiencies in the highest impact areas allows the rest of the\r\norganisation to keep delivering while still reducing waste. And without\r\nboard level support such an effort cannot overcome the structural and\r\ncultural pressures that keep sustainability work on the sidelines. When the\r\nboard backs it sustainability becomes part of how the organisation operates\r\nrather than an optional good intention.",
