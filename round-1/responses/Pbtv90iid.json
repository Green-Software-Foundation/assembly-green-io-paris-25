  "response": "1: When you think about the environmental impact of software, who comes to\r\nmind as responsible for it? And why did that person or group come to mind?\r\nSoftware Developers - they seem to have the most control (at least\r\nsuperficially)\r\n\r\n3: In your experience, who is currently making decisions about the\r\nenvironmental impact of software? Is it the right set of people?\r\nIt's mostly executives within software companies in an ostensible response\r\nto customer demand (or where they think the customer is going) - it's also\r\nthe data center companies\r\n\r\n3: What barriers have you or your organization encountered when trying to\r\naddress software's environmental impact?\r\ndeprioritization vs \"mission critical\" work like trying to meet customer\r\nfeature demands. perceived lack of control if all of the software runs on\r\nhyperscale data centers we don't operate. lack of ability to monetize if\r\nthere is a green premium for something (like a cleaner but more costly data\r\ncenter region)\r\n\r\n",
