And why did that person or group come to \r\nmind?*\r\n\r\n*\r\n*\r\n\r\n*It is the user who is the ultimate decider. Without users there is no \r\nneed, no electriciy to feed the computers and thus no impact. But the to \r\nits defense, the user cuurently has limited and/or incorrect information \r\nabout the environmental impact of the software it relies on.*\r\n\r\n\r\n*2: In your experience, who is currently making decisions about the \r\nenvironmental impact of software? Is it the right set of people? \r\nBuilding on the answer from question 1, people feeding the information \r\nrelied on by the users to assess the environmental of software are \r\nindirectly making decisions. Depending on the motivation/objectives of \r\nthe people providing the information, they might willingly or \r\nunwillingly lead the users to take actions that will adversly affect the \r\nenvironmental impact of the software. Case in point are the SLA's from \r\ncloud providers that rarely provide the user with the necessary \r\ninformation relating to the electricity used (local carbon intensity, \r\nprice) to behave in a manner that would reduce the environmental impact. \r\nMost of the the time, the environmental impact is reported ex-post \r\nwithout incentive or adverse consequences. \"Last month you have run 30 \r\nred lights\", but no incentive to drive in a more responsible manner.*\r\n\r\n\r\n*3: What barriers have you or your organization encountered when trying \r\nto address software's environmental impact? The quality of the \r\ninformation provided regarding the electricity used is generally of very \r\naggregated level like national averages whereas what is required is \r\nlocal forecast with the right financial and/or social incentives for the \r\nuser to behave in a manner that will minimize its environmental impact \r\nof software usage. This very local information would also impact \r\nhardware decisions: building locations, cooling inertia management.",
