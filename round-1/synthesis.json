  "text": "# Consensus Position Statement\n\n**Who Should Own Software's Environmental Impact?**\n\nResponsibility for software's environmental impact must be shared across multiple stakeholders, not owned by a single group. Governments should establish regulatory frameworks and sustainability goals, while companies and institutions implement these through practical technical and operational decisions. Engineers, architects, and developers influence impact through design choices affecting energy consumption. Platform teams set efficiency baselines through infrastructure configuration. Product owners and managers prioritize optimization work. Cloud providers and vendors shape impact through service design. Leadership must provide board-level support to make sustainability a strategic priority rather than optional work.\n\nCurrently, decision-making is fragmented and indirect, with infrastructure teams, FinOps, ESG functions, and developers each influencing outcomes without alignment. However, end users ultimately drive demand and should receive better information to make environmentally informed choices. The primary barrier is not lack of intent—most people want to do the right thing—but rather insufficient visibility into energy consumption, constant delivery pressure, misaligned incentives, and separation between sustainability reporting and engineering practice.\n\n---\n\n## Areas of Agreement\n\nParticipants universally agree that responsibility is distributed across multiple groups rather than concentrated in one role. There's strong consensus that current efforts are inadequate and fragmented, with decision-making scattered across disconnected functions. All responses acknowledge that people generally intend to act responsibly but face systemic barriers. Participants agree that lack of visibility into actual energy consumption at decision-making levels hampers progress, and that operational pressures consistently deprioritize sustainability work.\n\n---\n\n## Areas of Disagreement\n\n**Primary responsibility emphasis**: Some participants emphasize government regulation as the essential foundation, while others place users as ultimate deciders since they drive demand. One perspective advocates for dedicated \"cleanup crews\" with board support to systematically address high-impact areas, while others focus on collective responsibility without proposing dedicated organizational structures.\n\n**Information and incentives**: Views differ on whether the solution requires better user-facing information to enable informed choices, or whether the focus should be on providing engineers better visibility into technical implementation impacts.\n\n---\n\n## Conflicting or Incompatible Positions\n\nNo fundamentally incompatible positions were identified. The different emphases on government regulation, user responsibility, organizational structures, and technical visibility represent complementary rather than contradictory perspectives on a complex, multi-stakeholder challenge.\n\n---\n\n## Follow-On Questions\n\n1. **If you could change one thing to make software sustainability more actionable in your daily work, what would it be?**\n\n2. **Should organizations create dedicated roles or teams focused on software sustainability, or should it be everyone's responsibility integrated into existing roles?**\n\n3. **What information about environmental impact would you need at the moment of making a technical decision to actually change that decision?**",
