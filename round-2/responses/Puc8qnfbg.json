  "response": "I think everyone is responsible, focus should be on casual relationship with the impact. End users should be made aware and get incentive to limit their user, software developers should optimize (for software used at larger scales mostly), organizations should do both. I like the analogy with cars, car manufacturers should built clean cars cleanly, electricity and fuel suppliers should do so green, and I limit my driving. To improve, we all need incentive to do so, we all carry some responsibility.\r\n\r\n________________________________",
