  "response": "Hi,\r\n\r\nFrom my position as aspiring GreenOps engineer I want to share my view on\r\nthe ownership issue your raise.\r\n\r\nI agree that the responsibility is split over various levels as you already\r\nsynthesized, and I don't think that will change significantly. What I do\r\nthink is that we need to increase and improve communication between all\r\nstakeholders to realise a better workflow for actual implementers.\r\nCurrently I feel like this fragmentation is a major blocker for actual\r\nimplementation as there are various ways to tackle sustainability. This is\r\nof course due to the nature of a company or organisations business and way\r\nof working but generalised standards and tools could really help in this\r\nregard.\r\n\r\nFor me personally I think some kind of mindset change is required for\r\nmanagement to make sustainability among the highest priorities of the\r\norganisation. For me this is already logical as an unsustainable company\r\nhas an inherent path to failure. However current sentiment seems to be\r\nfocused mainly on finance. This should be incentivised by law. If the\r\nmindset is like that than this opens many possibilities to actual\r\nsustainable improvements which in the end will actually improve the\r\nfootprint and also the finances.\r\n\r\nI think initially dedicated teams within organisations are required to\r\nkickstart the sustainability efforts. This team can gather and spread\r\ninformation and workflows to help others outside the team understand the\r\npotential impacts. Once the initial improvements have been successfully\r\nimplemented and verified these can be used as examples to include the rest\r\nof the organisation in these workflows and create a culture where\r\nsustainability is part of the core culture within the company from the\r\nstart of any project and improving legacy. Eventually this would lead to a\r\ndeprecation of this team as its not required anymore as the culture is\r\npresent company wide.\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, an open framework for a standardized way to measure and report the\r\nsustainability is a key part in my opinion for broad adaptation of these\r\npractices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMet vriendelijke groet, / Kind regards,\r\n\r\n\r\nRover van der Noort\r\n\r\nDevOps Engineer\r\n\r\n\r\nKeyserswey 79, 2201 CX Noordwijk (NL)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Dec 10, 2025, 12:03 Green Software Foundation\r\n<[REDACTED]> wrote:",
