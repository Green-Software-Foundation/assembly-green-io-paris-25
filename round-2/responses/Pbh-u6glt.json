  "response": "I think everyone wants to do the best they can with the information they have. There’s a lack of information given by corporations to their employees on their stance on sustainability and the environment, and a lot do it just because they have to for their brand. There should be at least a consultant to help leaders know what they should do, so they can give employees the right steps and information to achieve the best for the planet. Although, it should be part of everyone’s mindset and everyone should be responsible for it as we’re all part of the planet.\r\n________________________________",
