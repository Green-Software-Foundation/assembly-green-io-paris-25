  "text": "# Consensus Statement: Round 2\n\n## TL;DR\nParticipants agree that sustainability requires dedicated teams initially to build capacity and establish standards, followed by integration into everyone's responsibilities through performance frameworks, cultural change, and standardized measurement tools.\n\n## Core Challenge\nOrganizations struggle to operationalize sustainability because responsibility is diffused without clear mechanisms for implementation. While participants agree everyone should ultimately be responsible, this creates accountability gaps in practice.\n\n## Current State\nSustainability efforts lack coordination, with fragmented approaches across organizations and no standardized framework for measurement or reporting. Management prioritizes financial metrics over environmental ones, and individual contributors lack clear guidance on sustainable practices.\n\n## What Participants Believe Is Needed\nDedicated sustainability teams should launch organizational efforts by gathering information, establishing workflows, creating standardized measurement frameworks, and demonstrating initial improvements. These teams would build capacity and spread knowledge until sustainability becomes embedded in organizational culture. Simultaneously, sustainability metrics must be integrated into senior leadership KPIs to drive accountability from the top. Legal incentives are needed to shift management mindset beyond purely financial priorities. Open, standardized frameworks for measuring and reporting environmental impact would enable broad adoption across organizations.\n\n## Practical Approaches\nStart conversations within teams about sustainability trade-offs in code reviews and design decisions. Use initial dedicated team successes as examples to spread practices organization-wide. Incorporate green targets into existing performance frameworks rather than creating separate \"green owners.\"\n\n## Path Forward\nBegin with focused teams to establish foundation and tools, then transition toward distributed responsibility once cultural shift is achieved and sustainability knowledge exists across all roles.\n\n---\n\n## Areas of Agreement (87 words)\n\nParticipants universally agree that while responsibility should ultimately be distributed across all roles, this requires foundational work first. Everyone concurs that current fragmentation blocks progress and that standardized measurement frameworks are essential. There is strong consensus that management mindset change is necessary, driven by legal incentives and leadership KPIs. Participants agree dedicated roles risk tokenism if they remain permanent, but are valuable for kickstarting efforts. All emphasize that sustainability should be integrated into daily work practices like code reviews and design decisions, becoming part of core organizational culture rather than separate initiatives.\n\n## Areas of Disagreement (76 words)\n\nParticipants differ on timing and sequencing. Some emphasize immediate integration into everyone's role to avoid the friction of dedicated teams, arguing separate roles lead to \"go speak to our green guy\" dynamics. Others stress the necessity of dedicated teams initially to establish expertise, tools, and workflows before broader distribution is feasible. There is also variance in where primary leverage lies. Some emphasize individual actions and team-level cultural shifts, while others focus on executive accountability through KPIs and regulatory pressure as the essential driver.\n\n## Conflicting or Incompatible Positions (62 words)\n\nOne genuine tension exists regarding dedicated roles. Some participants explicitly warn that creating separate sustainability roles causes tokenistic responses and reduces everyone else's engagement, advocating for immediate integration across all positions. Others argue dedicated teams are essential prerequisites to build organizational capacity before distribution is possible. These positions appear contradictory but may represent different organizational contexts. Whether dedicated teams help or hinder depends on how they are structured and transitioned.\n\n## Follow-on Questions\n\n1. What specific authority and resources would initial dedicated sustainability teams need to effectively establish standards and influence technical decisions across an organization? How would they avoid becoming isolated consultants that others ignore?\n\n2. What concrete sustainability metrics should be included in senior leadership KPIs, and how should they be weighted against financial performance targets? How do you measure progress in ways that drive meaningful behavior change?\n\n3. For organizations choosing immediate integration over dedicated teams, what specific mechanisms prevent sustainability from being deprioritized when delivery pressure increases? How do you build expertise without concentrated focus?",
